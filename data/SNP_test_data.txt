BACKGROUND: Genotypes of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and its surface receptors, TNFRSF1A and TNFRSF1B, have been examined in terms of the progression, metastasis, clinical efficacy, and prognosis of various cancers; however, little is known about their effects on clinical outcome in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC).

According with previous research, our findings revealed that haplotypes of the COMT geneand genotypes of the Val158Met polymorphism play a key role on pain sensitivity in FM patients.	Val158Met	109	118	FM patients	171	182	positive

This study aimed to test the association between the Val158Met polymorphism rs4680 of the catechol-O-methyl transferase gene andanorexia nervosa (AN).	rs4680	76	82	(AN)	145	149	neutral

The present association studies found no association between AN and rs4680 when testing the allelic contrast [Utrecht odds ratio (OR)=1.14, P=0.14; Leiden OR=1.02, P=0.85].	rs4680	68	74	AN	61	63	negative

Meta-analytically combined evidence from the present genotypings and the literature search shows that the effect sizes are homogeneous across studies and that rs4680 is not associated with AN.	rs4680	159	165	AN	189	191	negative

In the case-control study that included 187patients with preeclampsia (cases) and 189 normal subjects (controls), the AA genotype and variant Met allele frequencies of Val158Met in the COMTgene were significantly higher in patients with preeclampsia than those in the control group (both p <0.05).

The Val108/158Met (rs4680) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene contributes to genetic susceptibility to schizophrenia, which is specifically related to impairments in executive functioning.	(rs4680)	18	26	schizophrenia	153	166	positive

A different genomic region composed of three SNPs(rs737865, rs4680, rs165599) within the COMT gene has been reported to be significantly associated with schizophrenia in Ashkenazi Jews.	rs737865	50	58	schizophrenia	153	166	positive

The SNP rs165599, which has been mapped to the 3'-UTR region of the COMT gene, was significantly associated with schizophrenia in our family study, and possibly associated with the age of onset, delusion/hallucination symptom dimension, and CPT performance.	rs165599	8	16	schizophrenia	113	126	positive

Therefore, COMT may contribute to the genetic risk for schizophrenia not through the Val108/158Met polymorphism, but through other variants that are situated 3' to this region, in the Taiwanese population.	Val108/158Met	85	98	schizophrenia	55	68	negative
